BLE Device Connection and Service Explorer

This script connects to a specific BLE device by MAC address and lists all
available services and their characteristics/attributes.

Requirements:
    - bleak library: pip install bleak

Usage:
    python connect_ble_device.py [MAC_ADDRESS]

Example:
    python connect_ble_device.py 24:EC:4A:76:00:32
